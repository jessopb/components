# @lbry/components
Styling for shared components across LBRY properties



### Installation

```bash
$ npm i @lbry/components sass -D SOON
```

We recommend using this module with [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) for its' focus on speed and low dependency count.

If you are using `@lbry/components`, you can safely remove [@lbry/color](https://github.com/lbryio/color) if you've already included it separately (this module includes it by default).



### Usage
